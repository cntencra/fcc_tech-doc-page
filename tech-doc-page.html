                <header>What is Git and Github</header>
                <p>
                    Git is a tool for keeping track of code changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Git is a type of distributed version control system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Github is a platform that stores your Git projects in an online repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In computer science a distributed system is a system where data or tasks are stored or carried out
                    across multiple devices. For software version control systems this can mean a clone of the repository 
                    of code is stored on every developers local machine.
                </p> 
                    A version control system is a system that tracks any changes made to files and folders and for 
                    these changes to be easily reversible and auditable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Git you can more easily create different versions of your code and work 
                    on these different versions simultaneously with other developers. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    If mistakes are made and the code stops behaving as expected you can use Git to revert back to 
                    previous versions of your code.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Git allows you to work on improving parts of your code in "branches".
                    In branches code changes can be tested without affecting the production code. Branches can allow for bug 
                    fixes that can be fully tested before being rolled out to users. Branches can also be used to create 
                    and test out new features.

                <header>Basic git workflow</header>
                <p>
                    Below is a basic workflow for using git on a daily basis
                </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Write code<code>print("Hello world")</code></li>
                    <li>Check status <code>:git status</code>
                    <p>
                        Checking the status of your files shows which files are staged for commiting to the repository,
                        which files are yet to be staged to the repository and which files are not being tracked by the 
                        repository.
                    </p> </li>
                    <li>Stage changes<code>:git add . or filename</code>
                        <p>
                            Staging the changes is where you select which changes are going to be added to the repository
                            on the next commit to the repository. All changes or individual file changes or parts of file changes
                            can be added. Keeping the commits small and of the same topic helps to make reviewing changes easier.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Commit changes<code>:git commit -m"Brief code change description" -m"more detailed description"</code>
                        <p>
                            Commiting the changes is where the changes are added to the local repository. This stage should
                            include a message to detail what changes have been made to make reviewing commits easier. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Push changes<code>:git push</code>
                        <p>
                            Push changes is when the recent commits are pushed up to the online repository. For example Github.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Github is an online repository for storing your code. the git push comand pushes
                    changes up to an online repository. There are many different online repositories
                    Github being one of these.

                <p>
                    When first starting to work on a project with other developers you will need to 
                    pull down the existing files from the repository. See below...
                </p>
                <ol type ="1">
                    <li>Change Directory<code>:git cd ../localdirectory</code> change directory to the relevant local directory 
                        where you want the repository to be stored</li>

                <p>
                    Creating a new repository maybe necessary if you are working on a new project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Start by creating a new folder on your local machine. 
                    There can already be files in this folder that you wish to start
                    tracking.
